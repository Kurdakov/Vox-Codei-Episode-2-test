1. Obviously, Vox Codei 2 now has moving blocks, compared to static blocks in 
so seems following things are needed:
	a) have moving blocks which are aka blocks	in breakout (arkanoid) games
	b) have multiple static maps on which it is easy to test bombs (like already done)
	c) a loop to simulate life of bombs for 3 steps  so that nothing wrong goes - if goes - just backtrack - so 'mini simulator for 3 steps with moving blocks')
	d) predict future positions of moving blocks ( basically blocks are moving by quite simple rules, so it is possible to predict their movements - blocks move
	up down or left right, but also - are restricted either by walls/passive nodes(#)/other nodes ( which might disappear - so range of movements might change
	during game )
	e) to get initial conditions ( how blocks are moving ) we need to wait second step - after which we can compare maps and extract directions of blocks - seems
	a first step to be done - finding directions and tracking if just second frame is always enough to predict )
	e) instead of predicting bombs effects on the same map - predict them into future ( by removing nodes on 'statically' generated maps)
	f) for plan - there is need not only place bomb but also indicate it's desired tick.
	
2.  From this follows that first step is that
    code few maps and compare by this figuring directions for nodes, test on all test cases if that is enought, then it will be possible to create nodes with movements
